# Modeller
## Comparative Homology Modelling of SARSCov2 NSP4 region

**Steps implemented in `NSP4.structure.ipynb`**:
1. Performing PSI-BLAST to find homologous sequence
2. Refining the target-template alignment
3. Constructing the model by satisfying spatial restraints
4. Evaluating model (and template) by generating DOPE profile
5. Visualizing modelled structure
6. Visualizing DOPE profiles of model and template

Submitted as an assignment for M. S. Madhusudhan's Bioinformatics course at IISER Pune.
